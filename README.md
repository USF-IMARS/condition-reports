# condition-reports

This repository is an IMaRS-tech group project designed to explore markdown, jekyll, Rmd, jupyter, and other technologies to help address Specific Condition Report Questions (SCRQs).

Within the "pages" directory is a markdown (`.md`) file addressing each of the SCRQs sections from the 2018 CR Guidance document (pg 7). 
These sections (and their IMaRS developer usertag) are:

* Drivers and Pressures (NONE)
* Water Quality
* Habitat Resources 
* Living Resources 
* Maritime Archaeological Resources (NONE)
