Question 10: What is the integrity of major habitat types and how is it changing?

We can put R chunks here.
Example R plot:

```{r}
# Define a made-up data vector with 5 values
my_data <- c(1, 3, 6, 4, 9)

# Graph cars using blue points overlayed by a line
plot(my_data, type="o", col="blue")

# Create a title with a red, bold/italic font
title(main="My Data Plot", col.main="red", font.main=4)
```

**TODO**: what plots can we put here relevant to the CR question?
