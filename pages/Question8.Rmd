Potential data sources:
1. NDBC buoys
2. Climate online link to Key West temp. records (how far back)
3. Plots of SST over time (dashboard)

test python:

```{python}
x = 42 * 2
print(x) 
```

test python plots:
```{python}
%matplotlib notebook
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([0, 2, 1, 4])
plt.show()
```
